## What is it about?

Interactive Ink SDK is the best way to integrate handwriting recognition capabilities into your Android application. Interactive Ink extends digital ink to allow users to more intuitively create, interact with, and share content in digital form. Handwritten text, mathematical equations or even diagrams are interpreted in real-time to be editable via simple gestures, responsive and easy to convert to a neat output.

This repository contains a "get started" example, a complete example and a reference implementation of the Android integration part that developers using Interactive Ink SDK can reuse inside their projects.

## Getting started
